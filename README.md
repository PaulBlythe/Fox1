Work in progress flight simulator

This holds my ongoing work on a new flight simulator.

It is work in progress, nothing is complete, but bits of it may be useful to other people so I decided to create a repo.

It is split into two main areas , tools, and game. I also have an area for useful data that other people might use. For example there is a database of world war two RAF bases.

The game uses Monogame as a base renderer, though I have had to modify Monogame itself to do what I need it to do. With stock Monogame you will have some rendering issues.
