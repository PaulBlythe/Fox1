Work in progress flight simulator

This holds my ongoing work on a new flight simulator.

It is work in progress, nothing is complete, but bits of it may be useful to other people so I decided to create a repo.

It is split into two main areas , tools, and game.

The game uses Monogame as a base renderer, though I have had to modify Monogame itself to do what I need it to do.
