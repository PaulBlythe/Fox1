Work in progress flight simulator

This holds my ongoing work on a new flight simulator.

It is work in progress, nothing is complete, but bits of it may be useful to other people so I decided to create a repo.

It is split into two main areas , tools, and game. I also have an area for useful data that other people might use. For example there is a database of world war two RAF bases.

The game uses Monogame as a base renderer, though I have had to modify Monogame itself to do what I need it to do. With stock Monogame you will have some rendering issues.

The objective is to create a great game which is a very good flight simulator. 

The flight sims out there at the moment are either focused on total authencity with no game, or totally focused on the game with hardly a thought to the flight simulation.

There are older games that fit into the area I am targeting, such as IL2, but they come up short compared to the game play I want in a flight simulator.

I also have started some external panels. These are designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a touch screen and form part of a simulated cockpit.
